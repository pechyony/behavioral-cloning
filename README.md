## Setup

* Follow instructions [here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit/blob/master/doc/configure_via_anaconda.md) to set up Anaconda environment of Term 1 . You can verify that your environment is set up correctly using the instructions [here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit-Test).
* Download driving simulator from [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/fbf77062-5703-404e-b60c-95b78b2f3f9e/modules/6df7ae49-c61c-4bb2-a23e-6527e69209ec/lessons/46a70500-493e-4057-a78e-b3075933709d/concepts/1c9f7e68-3d2c-4313-9c8d-5a9ed42583dc).

## Files
* model.py - code for training neural network and generating a model
* model.h5 - model generated by model.py
* drive.py - code for driving a car using generated model
* video.mp4 - video of driving using the model model.h5
* writeup_report.md - description of the process of data gathering and building a model
* images - folder of images used in writeup_report.md

## Usage

* Activate environment of Term 1 by running

     activate carnd-term1

* Run driving simulator, choose autonomous mode and the left track
* Go to directory of drive.py and run 

     python drive.py model.h5

* Alternatively, download  and play video.mp4
